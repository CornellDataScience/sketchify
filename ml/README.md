## Create virtual environment:
Make sure you are in `ml/`. Make sure your conda environments are all deactivated by running `conda deactivate` until there is no active environment. Then, if you don't already have a `venv` folder, run `python3 -m venv venv`.

## Activate virtual environment:
`source venv/bin/activate`

## Install requirements:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
